# Prototype

Our first prototype can be accessed at our domain: [konsu.ai](https://konsu.ai/). It is a progressive web app (PWA), meaning that it can also be installed on both Android and iOS.

To get started, click 'Login' and then you can navigate to the 'Plan a Trip' page to chat with a virtual travel agent, powered by Google Gemini!

# Business Execution Journal

The business execution journal summarises all the steps we've taken to execute our business plan, giving a clear overview of all we've achieved along with our plans for the future. It can be found [here `./business-execution-journal.md`](./business-execution-journal.md).

# Video and Supplementary Report

To showcase Konsy to new potential customers and investors, we created a simple but effective product video. It aims to highlight key groups of potential customers, and show how Konsu would positively impact their holiday planning experience.

The video can be found on our YouTube channel here: []()

We also supply a supplementary report, covering more details related to our video and idea, which can be found [here `./video-report.md`](./video-report.md).
