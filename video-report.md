### Customer Demographics

Konsu is designed for people who need a break, but don’t have the time or energy to plan one. Our core customers include:

- Students, as they often want low-cost holidays but lack the time or knowledge to plan them.
- Working-class individuals who are juggling full-time jobs and personal commitments.
- Single parents who are balancing childcare, work, and finances.

These groups face tight budgets, time pressure, and high stress. Our marketing is emotionally resonant and direct - think: "Holiday planning getting you stressed?" or "Too much on your plate to even think about a holiday?". We meet customers where they are - stressed, overworked, overwhelmed - and offer simple, accessible solutions. Our visuals and messaging aim to evoke recognition, relief, and trust.

### Customer Needs

Our users aren't just looking for a holiday - they’re looking for peace of mind. Konsu addresses the following key needs:

- **Stress Reduction:** Planning a holiday can be mentally draining. Konsu uses AI to remove that burden entirely.
- **Time-saving:** Our users don’t have time to browse 20 tabs comparing hotels and flights. Konsu instantly gives them curated, optimised itineraries.
- **Budget-conscious:** We find hidden deals and dynamically suggest ways to cut costs by switching flights, adjusting the dates, or booking alternative accommodation.
- **Comfort & experience maximisation:** Konsu prioritises user preferences, such as whether they want to chill by the beach or explore five museums a day.
- **Adaptability:** Plans can change. Our AI automatically rebooks or suggests changes in real-time if disruptions occur (e.g. flight delays, weather warnings).

What existing tools miss:

- AI planners like GuideGeek and Roam Around don’t do booking - they leave users halfway.
- Booking platforms like Expedia or Kayak require users to assemble every leg of the trip manually.
- No platform currently combines planning and booking in a fully integrated, seamless way.

### Product and Business Model

The product is well-demonstrated in our video, showcasing Konsu’s ability to:

- Ask natural language questions
- Build a full itinerary in seconds
- Let users customise or regenerate trips
- Offer instant booking links with transparent pricing.

Business Model:

- Konsu operates on a revenue-sharing model with travel service providers—hotels, airlines, and booking aggregators.
- We'll start by integrating with publicly available affiliate APIS (Booking.com, Skyscanner, etc.) that offer commission-based referrals.
- As our user base grows, we’ll negotiate improved rates directly with providers, increasing our margin while keeping costs the same for users.

This model is ethical and sustainable:

- No extra cost to users: Konsu earns from providers, not customers.
- Lean operations: AI handles 90% of queries; a small human support team manages edge cases, reducing staffing costs while maintaining compliance (e.g., ABTA protection for UK/EU travellers).
- Sustainability: We use low-emission server hosting platforms like Scaleway and time compute-intensive tasks (like AI training) during high-renewables availability hours.

### Meeting Customer Needs

Konsu is built to be an intelligent, intuitive assistant that handles the complexities of holiday planning, so users don’t have to. Whether someone is overwhelmed, budget-conscious, time-poor, or simply wants a stress-free getaway, Konsu provides instant, intelligent support at every stage.

**Students**: Students want adventure on a budget, often in larger groups. Konsu intelligently suggests group-friendly, low-cost destinations and activities like free city tours, local festivals, or areas with a vibrant nightlife. All the user has to do is enter a casual query like “cheap trip for six students with nightlife”, and Konsu returns ready-to-book itineraries that are fun, feasible, and affordable.

**Workers**: Busy professionals don’t have time to plan. Konsu makes sure they don’t have to. Users can simply say how many days they want off, and Konsu will calculate the best time and place to go, factoring in price trends, seasonal highlights, and availability. With just a few clicks, workers can go from idea to booked getaway—without sacrificing evenings to endless tab-switching.

**Parents**: Planning around children is tough. Konsu helps parents find safe, family-friendly holidays tailored to the needs of their children, taking into account age, accessibility, and interest. It can even suggest additional features like “date night” options, helping parents find trusted local babysitting services so they can enjoy a rare evening out.

**Experienced Travellers**: Even seasoned adventurers benefit from Konsu’s ability to optimise and streamline. Konsu handles multi-destination trips, transport coordination, and route optimisation behind the scenes. Konsu provides clear, transparent options for travellers who still want control and lets them edit any part of the plan on the fly, without starting from scratch.

**Eco-Conscious Travellers**: Konsu understands that many users want to reduce their carbon footprint. When prompted, it prioritises train routes, domestic options, and eco-certified accommodation. These values are built into Konsu’s recommendation engine and can be surfaced through simple user preferences like “eco-friendly holiday ideas.”

**When Things Go Wrong**: Holidays rarely go 100% to plan, but Konsu doesn’t panic. Whether it’s rain on the day of your beach trip or a cancelled train, Konsu adapts. It will offer indoor alternatives (like museums or galleries) and suggest spontaneous nearby experiences. In more serious cases like transport disruptions, it will automatically rebook where possible and notify users of next steps - all in real time.

### Konsu's Customer Flow

Here's how Konsu will guide users through an effortless end-to-end experience:

1. **Explore Page**: Users are shown ready-made, tailored holiday packages based on basic signals like IP-based location and general seasonal trends.
2. **Customisation**: Users can select a preset option or chat naturally with Konsu - for example, “I want a relaxing long weekend for under £300.”
3. **Itinerary Generation**: Konsu fetches real-time flight and accommodation data (via APIs like Amadeus), packages the trip, and shows 4-5 clear options in a neat layout.
4. **Detail Review**: Users can inspect each part of the plan - flight times, hotels, local transport - and request changes in plain English.
5. **Booking**: With one payment step, the entire trip is confirmed.
6. **Real-Time Travel Assistant**: During the holiday, Konsu provides live updates and responds to disruptions with smart, actionable changes.
7. **Ongoing Adaptation**: Need a backup plan for rainy days? Want to add a spontaneous day trip? Konsu listens and adjusts without hassle.

### Unique Selling Proposition

As part of our original business plan, we carried out extensive competitor analysis and secondary research to strongly define Konsu's unique selling proposition: personalised, end-to-end trip planning in a single platform. Despite many of our proposed features being present in existing platforms, such as Plantrip (https://plantrip.io) and TravelPal's (https://www.travelpal.ai) itinerary planner, [Booking.com](http://booking.com/)’s LLM trip planner, and [Expedia Romie](https://www.expedia.com/newsroom/spring-product-release-2024/)'s dynamic service features, they are yet to be integrated into one seamless user experience. Further to this, no competitor we found had features supporting longer, multi-destination trips, which is something we plan to add to Konsu to allow us to support all travellers, no matter their goals.
